Hi! I'm Zoe, a self-proclaimed foodie living in Austin, TX. I also am a software engineer working primarily on full stack web development. 

I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and cooking the recipes that I love to eat. Also, I love trying out the restaurants around Austin and wherever I travel!

This blog will chronicle my food adventures, so I'm excited for this!

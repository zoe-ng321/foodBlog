It's time for another edition of quarantine cooking! These dishes were from last month, so I'm a little late posting about these.

The first dish was a chicken and tomato stew from a [Bon Appetit recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-and-tomato-stew-with-caramelized-lemon). I've made this dish a few times before, and it's always delicious. This time I made it for dinner, but I forgot to put the leftovers in the fridge. Sadly since the pot was left out overnight, I had to throw everything away to avoid getting sick. I had got up early that day due to post-election day stress, so I was able to head to the grocery store before work to grab the ingredients to cook it again. Luckily, the second time around I remember to put the leftovers in the fridge, and I had the dish for 3 more meals!

I also made a corn and chickpea quinoa bowl. This was an improvised dish using up some of the canned chickpea and frozen corn I had. Along with the main ingredients, I added in some jalapeno, cilantro, and garlic and served it on some quinoa I cooked in chicken broth!

For dinner, my boyfriend and I had a sushi making night! We had bought some sushi grade salmon and seaweed from the local Japanese grocery store, and I already had some sushi rice. We used some avocade and made some sriracha mayo. We tried to make handrolls, but it was actually really hard to shape them. I also tried to make salmon nigiri. The sushi didn't look the best, but at least it tasted really good! The next day since we had some leftover sushi rice, we also made some tuna mayo onigiri!

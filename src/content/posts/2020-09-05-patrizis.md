One of my favorite restaurants in Austin is Patrizi's, an Italian food truck on Manor Rd. When i first went there,  I was blown away by how good the pasta is. Since then, I've taken my friends there and had many plates of delicious carbs!

My go-to order is the pomodoro with garlic bread. The pomodoro is super tomato-y with a lot of basil and a dollop of cheese. The garlic bread is amazing, and the garlic confit acts like a garlic spread. Some other of my favorites from the menu include the Great Leopold (a pesto pasta), the Diavolo (a garlicky olive oil pasta), and the salad. 

Usually it can be difficult to find parking at Patrizi's, but it has been easier recently due to them only doing takeout orders during coronavirus. Since shelter-in-place started in March, my boyfriend and I bought takeout from them numerous times. We always get two pastas, garlic bread, and a large salad.

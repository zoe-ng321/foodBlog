One of my favorite desserts that I've made is a Basque burnt cheesecake. I first saw the recipe on the Bon Appetit Youtube channel (the recipe can be found [here](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/basque-burnt-cheesecake)), and I knew that I had to try to make it. When I went to Ikea to buy things for my new apartment, I saw a spring form cake pan that was on sale, and I knew I had to buy it for this cheesecake.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make even though it's a cheesecake! Using a stand mixer, I just had to mix everything together and put it in the pan to bake. It doesn't look the best because it looks burnt, but it tastes amazing, mainly due to the 2 pounds of cream cheese and 2 cups of heavy cream in it!

I've made this cheesecake twice so far, once for my apartment warming party and another for a holiday party. This dessert was a hit each time! Since it's such a heavy food, I had to share some of the leftovers with my coworkers, so that I don't have to eat half a cheesecake by myself. 

I would recommend anyone who wants to make an impressive dessert but with little effort to try this recipe out!

Here's the new installation in my quarantine cooking series!

A few weeks ago, I made gumbo using a recipe from Binging with Babish (link [here](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/forrestgumpshrimp)). The last time I made this was senior year of college, so it's been about two years! 

The process was pretty simple. I first made the roux, ensuring that it was a dark chocolate color before adding the veggies. After the veggies cooked for a bit, I added the sausage and other spices and let it simmer for about an hour. Last I added the shrimp, and it was ready to eat!

I ended up with a huge pot of gumbo that took me about a week to finish. In addition, I had leftover okra that I roasted in the oven and some celery that I put in some stir fries. This is definitely something that I'll make again.

I also made a spicy Korean chicken stew recently! I found the recipe on subtle asian cooking, and it was super easy to make. I chopped up all the veggies (potatoes, carrots, onions, green onions, jalapenos, and cabbage) and added it to the pot along with some chicken drumsticks. I then made the sauce with gochujang, Korean red pepper flakes, soy sauce, and garlic and mixed it in with all the other ingredients. I simmered the stew for about 45 minutes, and the end result was super spicy but very delicious! My boyfriend especially enjoyed the potatoes, and he just made it yesterday. This recipe would be perfect for the winter!

For lunch today, I made some shrimp tacos! I defrosted some shrimp and then seasoned them with cumin, cayenne, paprika, oregano, salt and pepper. I cooked them for 3-4 minutes until fully cooked. 

Then it was taco assembly time! I added my shrimp, some spicy guacamole from HEB, shredded cabbage, and   cilantro. The tacos were really good, and it was simple to make!

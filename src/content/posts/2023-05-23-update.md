W﻿ow I haven't updated this food blog in a while!  It's been almost 2 years since my last post, and a lot has changed! The world has mostly returned to normal with quarantines and lockdowns ending, and I've traveled quite a bit! 

I also started a food Instagram, and that's where I've mainly been posting for the past 2 years. There, I've posted about the food I try from restaurants in Austin and my travel destinations, but on this blog, I'll try to post more about the food that I'm cooking! 

I﻿'ve been a bit lazy about trying new recipes lately, but for now, I'll start by writing a few blogs posts about my travels in the post-Covid era and the food I tried in those places! Look forward to posts about Seattle, Washington D.C., Las Vegas, Boston, and London! 

In the meantime, follow me on Instagram! @zoe.food.bytes

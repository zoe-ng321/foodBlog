These are some fun foods that I cooked last month!

This kimchi and tofu stew that I made was based off [this recipe](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/tofu-and-kimchi-stew) from Bon Appetit. Instead of the chicken broth and daikon, I used some beef bone broth that I had bought from HMart and potatoes. This dish was super easy to make since I only had boil all the ingredients together until the potatoes were tender. It's a great dish to eat with rice since it can get pretty spicy!

For another easy dish, I made some Japanese curry. I always use the SB boxed curry mix, and it's a super simple dish to make. I always end up with leftovers that can last around five meals since one batch makes a lot of food! I served this with rice and some sauteed spinach for some extra veggies!

For dinner, I made this shrimp and eggs dish. Growing up, my mom always made this dish, and it was one of my favorites! For this, I used some pre-boiled shrimp and added some sesame oil to my usual scrambled eggs.  It may not be the same as my mom's, but it's pretty close.

This chicken quinoa bowl is super healthy dish! I seared and baked some chicken breast that turned out really juicy. I also roasted some canned chickpeas with a variety of spices. Once all the components were prepped, I only had to assemble this dish. In addition to the cooked components (chickpeas, chicken, and quinoa), I added some cherry tomatoes, spring mix, cucumber, avocado, and radish. I had to use a lot of containers to store all of this in the fridge, but it was worth it! I would definitely make this again when I want some healthy meals!

It's time for another edition of quarantine cooking!

I made a chicken fajita bowl that was super delicious! I marinated some chicken thighs and pan fried them. I really wished I had a splatter guard becuase oil splattered everywhere. I also cooked some bell pepper and onion in the residual chicken fat and stir fried some corn and black beans. I then plated everything up over some cilantro lime quinoa (to be healthy) and topped it with some avocado and dressing. It was a lot to prepare, but it was worth the effort. I did have to use a lot of containers since I had to store each component in the fridge separately.

My boyfriend and I also made honey walnut shrimp one night for dinner. The day before, we made the candied walnuts which wasn't difficult. After we made the dish, we had a lot of leftover candied walnuts that we snacked on. We fried the shrimp and made the sauce with mayo, condensed milk, and some other ingredients. Then it was a matter of mixing everything together. I also steamed some broccoli to add some veggies to the plate. We served everything up with some white rice. It was pretty good, but next time, we'd probably order the dish instead.

For dinner another night, my boyfriend and I baked a whole fish. He never ate a whole fish before, and I had never cooked one myself. Therefore, we decided to give it a shot. We bought a fish at HMart that was already cleaned and descaled. We had planned on steaming it Cantonese style, but we didn't have a pan with a lid that was big enough to hold the fish. Instead, we baked it in the oven, and it turned out pretty well. We were pretty hungry, so I didn't get a picture of the final product. Dipping it in ponzu was also delicious. We are definitely going to try this again!

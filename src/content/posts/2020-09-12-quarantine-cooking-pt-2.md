Here's the second part in my quarantine cooking series where I try out new recipes!

For dinner, I made steak tacos along with some street corn. For the tacos, I marinated the flank steak for a few hours with some cumin, chili powder, soy sauce, lime, and oregano. Then I pan fried it until the beef was cooked, and I assembled my tacos with some guacamole, cheese, and cilantro. I also used some of the tortillas that are made fresh at HEB, so the tacos were really good! I shared the recipe with my boyfriend, and he's made the tacos a few times also.

For the street corn, I used some frozen corn, and I added some chili powder, chipotle chili powder, lime juice, and Kewpie mayo. It was a pretty simple addition to my taco dinner!

Another recipe we tried cooking was beef bourguignon. My boyfriend introduced me to Food Wars, an anime all about food. We saw them cooking this in one episode, and we decided to give it a try. In the show, the main character, Soma, marinates the beef with honey to get make it extra tender, but the actual result wasn't as dramatic as it was in the show. In addition, we roasted some cauliflower as a side dish to provide some extra crunch. The end result admittedly doesn't look the best, but it was pretty delicious!

For a fancy brunch, I made some avocado toast with some marinated eggs. The day before, I made some marinated eggs after seeing many posts about it on Subtle Asian Cooking, and it wasn't hard at all! I boiled the eggs for about 6 minutes and quickly submerged them in ice water. I made the marinade with soy sauce, water, and a serrano pepper, and then I added the eggs to it. 

The avocado toast did not take long to assemble. I mashed the avocado with salt, pepper, and lemon juice and toasted the bread. Then I placed everything on the bread, and it was ready to eat! 

The egg in the picture looks a little funky because the shell split while boiling, and I could have used some fancier bread. Other than those two things, I could totally sell this for $12 in a restaurant.

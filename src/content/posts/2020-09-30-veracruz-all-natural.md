One of my favorite taco spots in Austin would have to be Veracruz All Natural! I first tried it out when a few of my friends and I did a taco tour around Austin just before graduation. It was the last spot we went to, but it definitely stood out. Once I moved to my new apartment after college, I realized that I had a location less than 10 minutes away. Of course, it became my go-to spot for food, and I introduced more of my friends to the delicious tacos.

The must-get item here is definitely the migas taco! It's always stuffed to the brim, and it's the one that they are famous for. I usually alternate between the migas, al pastor, and fish tacos, getting 2 out of the 3. I've also tried the shrimp macha and migas poblanas tacos which are also great!

Sadly, the location near my apartment closed this past summer, but I'll gladly drive to get some of my favorite tacos! Check out their website [here](https://www.veracruzallnatural.com/)!

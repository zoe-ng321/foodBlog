It's been a little while since the last one, but I'm back for another edition of quarantine cooking!

My boyfriend and I had another homemade sushi night! After the last time we tried this, we bought a sushi mat, so we could actually try making a roll in addition to the hand roll. We bought some salmon and avocado, and I had some frozen shrimp that we added also. We made 2 cups of rice this time instead of 3, and it was the perfect amount for the both of us. It was still a bit of a struggle to make the rolls and handrolls, but it was definitely a fun experience! I'm looking forward to the next sushi night!

I had a craving for a bagel one week, so I decided to make my own bagel sandwiches for lunch! I bought bagels, smoked salmon, cream cheese, spinach, and cucumber, and I assembled it in open-faced sandwich form. The open faced nature did make it a bit hard to eat, since at a certain point, the cucumbers would start falling out. After I ran out of smoked salmon, I added some avocado instead. This was a nice lunch, and it satisfied my bagel craving.

For dinner, I made a ground turkey quinoa bowl, and it was my first time cooking ground turkey. I spontaneously grabbed a pack of it from HEB and added some cumin, cayenne, coriander powder, and other spices to it while stir frying it. The spices made the turkey taste really good! I also cooked up some quinoa and stir fried some bok choy to go along with it. Finally I added some sliced radish and cucumber, and that's my turkey quinoa bowl! It's definitely an option that I'll reach for when I want to cook something on the healthier side.

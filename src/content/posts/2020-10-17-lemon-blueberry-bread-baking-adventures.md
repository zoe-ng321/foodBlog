Recently, my boyfriend and I made lemon blueberry bread! He had a cooking contest at work where he could to submit a picture of something he made, and everyone would vote on their favorite picture. He decided on a dessert because he has a massive sweet tooth.

The bread was super easy to make, and the entire apartment smelled wonderful afterwards. We managed to eat half of the bread the day we baked it, and we finished the entire thing in three days! Next time, we might try making it in muffin form.

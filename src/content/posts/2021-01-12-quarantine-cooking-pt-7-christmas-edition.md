For Christmas, my boyfriend and I spent the day cooking up some delicious food!

For lunch, we made some tofu gyros. My boyfriend had found the recipe online a few days prior, and he wanted to try it out. We marinated the tofu in some tomato paste, soy sauce, and other spices, and as we were pan frying it, the tofu made the apartment smell so good! We also made tzatziki to go with the gyros. To assemble the dish, we also added some shredded lettuce and cherry tomatoes. It was really good and healthy!

After lunch, we made some snowball cookies! I found the [recipe from Delish](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a56364/best-snowball-cookies-recipe/), and we decided to make them when we realized we already had all the ingredients. The dough was easy to make, and after they were baked, we coated them in a ton of powdered sugar. The cookies were super buttery and sugary!

For Christmas dinner, we made a rack of lamb along with some roasted potatoes and broccoli. Last time we went to Costco, I found some vacuumed packed racks of lamb from Australia, and they weren't too expensive. I had never cooked a whole rack of lamb before, so we decided to give it a try! We marinated the lamb in some rosemary, thyme, and garlic and roasted it in the oven for about 30 minutes.

I plated the lamb chops up with some rosemary roasted potatoes and roasted broccoli, and it was time to dig in! The lamb was slightly undersalted but still very delicious! I would definitely try making this again!

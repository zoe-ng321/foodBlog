For our latest baking adventure, my boyfriend and I made the famous 100 hour brownies! We came across the [original video from Alvin Zhou](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28NB3L9YuVI) one weekend while browsing cooking videos on Youtube, and we knew that we had to see if the brownies live up to the hype! My boyfriend ordered some espresso powder from Amazon, and we stocked up on chocolate bars for this recipe. We decided that we wanted to make the brownies in time for our anniversary dinner on Sunday, so we started the prep on Wednesday.

We made the brown butter which smelled super delicious, and I melted the chocolate in a double boiler. We made the rest of the batter and filled the baking pan. Then we topped it with a lot of chocolate, and it was time for it to take a 3 day nap in the fridge.

On Saturday, we put the brownies in the oven for about 30 minutes, and once they were finished baking, we put the pan into the freezer for another 30 minutes. After that, I moved them back into the fridge for another 24 hours.

On Sunday, it was finally time to eat the brownies! After our anniversary dinner, we warmed up the brownies in the oven, and we were both excited to dig in! The brownie was gooey, extremely chocolatey, and sweet. It was also really rich from the brown butter that we added, so it was also hard to eat more than one in a sitting. The brownie was also slightly gritty, possibly due to the espresso powder or user error, but it wasn't that big of an issue. We slowly finished the brownies over the course of a week, and it was nice to have a delicious dessert every day!

Overall, the brownies were extremely rich and delicious! I think next time I might reduce the amount of sugar in the brownies and not add the espresso powder into the brown butter since it clumped up quite a bit. I would make these again when I want a chocolate overload and don't mind waiting a few days!

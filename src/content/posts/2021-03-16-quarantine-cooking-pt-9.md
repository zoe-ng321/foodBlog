Here are some cool foods that I've made in the past few months!

One day, I made avocado toast topped with smoked salmon and some scrambled eggs on the side. I mashed up one small avocado with some salt, pepper, and lemon juice, and I stacked it on some bread with smoked salmon. This was really simple to make and delicious!

My boyfriend and I made some buttermilk fried chicken sandwiches! We both really like fried chicken sandwiches, and we wanted to try making them ourselves. We marinated some chicken thighs in a mixture of buttermilk and spices, and then the next day, we fried them in some really hot oil. We topped off the sandwiches with some tomato, shredded lettuce, pickles, and spicy mayo. The chicken was super crunchy and juicy, and overall it was a good sandwich. Next time, we want to try to find some brioche buns, since the ones we used were smaller. I would definitely make this again!

I also made some kimchi fried rice. Shortly after New Year's, my boyfriend and I made a trip to HMart to pick up some groceries. I was planning on buying some kimchi so that I could make my kimchi tofu stew, but the smallest size of kimchi was a gallon! I ended up buying the gallon of kimchi, and I needed more recipes to use that up. I added some kimchi and ground beef to the fried rice, and I topped it with a fried egg. The rice was really good!

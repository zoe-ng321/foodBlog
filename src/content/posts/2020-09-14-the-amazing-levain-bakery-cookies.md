One of my favorite chocolate chip cookies is the one from Levain Bakery in New York City. These cookies are huge; they are 6 oz and about an inch thick!

The first time I had this cookie was when I went to NYC in Summer 2015 with my relatives. I tried both the chocolate chip walnut and the double chocolate cookies.

When I traveled to NYC again in 2019 for a spring break trip with my friends, I knew I had to get these cookies again! I had planned for us to go get the cookies after we explored the Met, but some of us wanted to continue exploring or go back to the hotel. That wasn't going to stop me from getting the cookies, so I decided to take everyone's order and go there myself. I brought the cookies back to the hotel, and we got dinner. My friends got some food from the carts around Times Square, and I went to Xian Famous Foods to get the spicy cumin lamb noodles. After dinner, we had the cookies! Everyone was amazed by how big the cookies were. I was pretty full after dinner, so I only had half of it that day and finished the rest the next day.

A month ago, I learned that these cookies were going to be sold at Central Market, my favorite grocery store, so I knew I had to go buy some. The cookies were in stock on a Wednesday, and my boyfriend and I went on Friday, just a few days later. But when we arrived in the frozen section of the store. we only saw two of the varieties, Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter and Oatmeal Raisin, in stock. Clearly, no one likes oatmeal raisin because there was one shelf of the dark chocolate, and the rest of the fridge was filled with oatmeal raisin cookies. I had really wanted the chocolate chip walnut ones, but I guess everyone had the same idea. I grabbed a box of the dark chocolate peanut butter cookies.

That night, I decided to try out these cookies. There were eight of them in the box. They were much smaller than the ones from the bakery at 2 oz, but they were just as thick. I popped them into a 350 F oven for 5 minutes, and they were ready to eat! My boyfriend had never tried these cookies before, and he thought they were really good! I enjoyed the cookie also, and I really want to go back and buy the chocolate chip walnut ones. These are a great way to enjoy the cookies without having to travel to New York City!

While I was in Japan, I had many delicious kinds of noodles!

1. Wagyu Beef Ramen - Menya Inoichi Hanare - Kyoto

   The ramen broth was light but very flavorful! The wagyu beef was delicious and rich! This was a really popular shop, so we waited for about an hour before eating.
2. Duck Ramen - Gion Duck Noodles - Kyoto

   This shop was in an alley, so it was a bit hard to find. We waited for about an hour even at an off-peak time. The ramen was light and delicious!
3. Flat Udon - Godaime Hanayama Udon - Tokyo

   This was the first time that I had udon that was this wide! The udon was super chewy and fun to slurp! It came with a soy sauce based dipping sauce and a sesame sauce. It also came with tempura shrimp and maitake mushrooms, which were super good!
4. Chicken Ramen - Ginza Kagari - Tokyo

   I got the chicken ramen, and the broth was really rich for being chicken broth! I would recommend the truffle version of the ramen instead of the normal one!
5. Beef Udon - Udon Shin - Tokyo

   This was one of the longest waits for a restaurant during our time in Japan, but it was worth it! We arrived at the restaurant at around 9:00am to put our names on the waitlist, and estimated time we would enter was 1:30pm! In the meantime, we walked around the neighborhood, got breakfast, and went to the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden. We arrived back at the restaurant around 1pm to place our order. I got a beef udon that was really good and the udon was chewy!
6. Matcha Soba - Nakamura Tokichi - Uji

   While in Uji, I stopped at a tea shop that also sold food and desserts. The restaurant overlooked the river and had an amazing view! I got the kitsune matcha soba which was really unique.
7. Udon - Tengu - Kyoto

   This was a hidden spot that is popular with locals! I had the nabe udon which was steaming hot and filled with lots of ingredients!
8. Matcha Soba - 茶そば寿庵 喜多院店 - Kawagoe

   We stumbled upon this shop after visiting the temple in Kawagoe. It was popular with the locals. I ordered a hot soupy version of soba, and it came with tempura. We also ordered a side of sweet potato tempura, since Kawagoe is famous for its sweet potatoes. Since it was a cold day, the hot soba really hit the spot and warmed me up!
